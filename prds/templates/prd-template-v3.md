## Document Completion Order

> ⚠️ **For LLM Agents:** Complete sections in this order. Do not fill downstream sections until upstream human-required inputs exist.

1. **Context** (Background, Scope) → requires human input first
2. **Problem Statement & User Story** → requires human input
3. **Requirements** (Must/Should/Could/Won't) → requires human input
4. **Technical Constraints** → human review
5. **Diagrams, Data Model, Interface** → LLM can draft after above exist
6. **Acceptance Criteria** → derived from requirements
7. **Everything else** → can proceed

## Requirements

<!-- 
IMPORTANT: Each requirement MUST have a unique ID for traceability.
Format: [Priority]-[Number] (e.g., M-1, S-2, C-1, W-1)
Acceptance Criteria must reference these IDs.
AR and SEC documents will trace back to these IDs.
-->
<!-- @agent: Do not invent requirements. Only extract from the Problem Statement. Use strict MUST/SHOULD/COULD formats. -->

### Must Have (M) — MVP, launch blockers 🔴 `@human-required`
- [ ] **M-1:** [Requirement with clear, testable language using "shall"]
- [ ] **M-2:** [Requirement]

### Should Have (S) — High value, not blocking 🔴 `@human-required`
- [ ] **S-1:** [Requirement]
- [ ] **S-2:** [Requirement]

### Could Have (C) — Nice to have, if time permits 🟡 `@human-review`
- [ ] **C-1:** [Requirement]

### Won't Have (W) — Explicitly deferred 🟡 `@human-review`
<!-- Document WHY each item is deferred -->
- [ ] **W-1:** [Deferred item] — *Reason: [why deferred]*

---

## Technical Constraints 🟡 `@human-review`

[List any technical guardrails the implementing agent must respect]

- **Language/Framework:** [e.g., Rust, must use existing crate X]
- **Performance:** [e.g., must complete in <100ms]
- **Compatibility:** [e.g., must support API v2 and v3]
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., cannot add new external dependencies without approval]

---

## Data Model (if applicable) 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
@human-review: Ensure this defines WHAT is needed (fields, relationships), 
not HOW it is implemented (database-specific types, indexes). 
Implementation details belong in the AR.
-->

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY_A ||--o{ ENTITY_B : contains
    ENTITY_A {
        string id PK
        string name
        datetime created_at
    }
    ENTITY_B {
        string id PK
        string entity_a_id FK
        string value
    }
```

---

## Interface Contract (if applicable) 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
@human-review: Ensure this defines the CONTRACT (inputs/outputs), 
not the implementation. Avoid over-committing to specific libraries or patterns.
-->

```typescript
// Input
interface FeatureInput {
  requiredField: string;
  optionalField?: number;
}

// Output
interface FeatureOutput {
  success: boolean;
  data?: ResultType;
  error?: ErrorType;
}
```

---

## Evaluation Criteria 🟡 `@human-review`

| Criterion | Weight | Metric | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| [e.g., Performance] | High | Response time | <100ms p95 | |
| [e.g., Accuracy] | Critical | Error rate | <0.1% | |

---

## Tool/Approach Candidates 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
LLM may draft this section, but human must validate:
- License compatibility
- Security posture of dependencies  
- Team familiarity
- Long-term maintenance burden
-->

| Option | License | Pros | Cons | Spike Result |
|--------|---------|------|------|--------------|
| Option A | | | | |
| Option B | | | | |

### Selected Approach 🔴 `@human-required`
> **Decision:** [Filled after spike]  
> **Rationale:** [Why this option over others]

---

## Acceptance Criteria 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
Each AC must reference a Requirement ID.
Use Given/When/Then format — directly translatable to tests.
-->

| AC ID | Requirement | Given | When | Then | Target File | Test Command |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| AC-1 | M-1 | [precondition] | [action] | [expected result] | [e.g., src/api/routes.ts] | [e.g., npm test src/api/routes.test.ts] |
| AC-2 | M-2 | [precondition] | [action] | [expected result] | [e.g., src/api/routes.ts] | [e.g., npm test src/api/routes.test.ts] |
| AC-3 | S-1 | [precondition] | [action] | [expected result] | [e.g., src/api/routes.ts] | [e.g., npm test src/api/routes.test.ts] |

### Edge Cases 🟢 `@llm-autonomous`
- [ ] **EC-1:** (M-1) When [edge condition], then [expected behavior]
- [ ] **EC-2:** (M-2) When [edge condition], then [expected behavior]

---

## Dependencies 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
LLM may draft based on context, but human must validate:
- Ownership of dependencies
- Timeline alignment
- External system constraints
-->

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph This Feature
        A[NNN-prd-slug]
    end
    subgraph Requires
        B[NNN-prd-xxx] --> A
        C[NNN-prd-yyy] --> A
    end
    subgraph Blocks
        A --> D[NNN-prd-zzz]
    end
```

- **Requires:** none | NNN-prd-xxx
- **Blocks:** none | NNN-prd-xxx
- **External:** [any external system dependencies]
