## Purpose

This is a **lightweight security review** intended to catch obvious security concerns early in the product lifecycle. It is NOT a comprehensive threat model. Full threat modeling should occur during implementation when infrastructure-as-code and concrete implementations exist.

**This review answers three questions:**
1. What does this feature expose to attackers?
2. What data does it touch, and how sensitive is that data?
3. What's the impact if something goes wrong?

**Scope of this review:**
- ✅ Attack surface identification
- ✅ Data classification
- ✅ High-level CIA assessment
- ❌ Detailed threat enumeration (deferred to implementation)
- ❌ Penetration testing (deferred to implementation)
- ❌ Compliance audit (separate process)

### Exposure Checklist 🟢 `@llm-autonomous`

Quick validation of common exposure risks:

- [ ] **Internet-facing endpoints require authentication**
- [ ] **No sensitive data in URL parameters** (query strings logged, cached, leaked via referrer)
- [ ] **File uploads validated** (type, size, content) if applicable
- [ ] **Rate limiting configured** for public endpoints
- [ ] **CORS policy is restrictive** (not `*`) if applicable
- [ ] **No debug/admin endpoints exposed** in production
- [ ] **Webhooks validate signatures** if receiving external events
