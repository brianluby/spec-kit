## Vision Statement 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
A single, aspirational sentence describing the future state the product enables.
This is the North Star — every PRD and feature should trace back to this statement.
Good vision statements are: ambitious, clear, customer-centric, and time-bounded.
-->

> [One sentence: What does the world look like when this product succeeds?]

**Time Horizon:** [e.g., 1 year | 3 years | 5 years]

---

## Mission Statement 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
How the product achieves the vision. More concrete than the vision, 
more stable than a roadmap. Answers: What do we do, for whom, and why?
-->

> [1-2 sentences: What does this product do, for whom, and what outcome does it deliver?]

---

## Context

### Background 🔴 `@human-required`

[2-4 paragraphs: Why does this product exist? What market shift, user pain, or strategic opportunity led to it? Include any relevant history — what was tried before, what changed, what makes now the right time.]

### Glossary 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- Define domain-specific terms, abbreviations, and key concepts. LLM agents and downstream PRDs should use these terms consistently. -->

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| [Term 1] | [Definition] |
| [Term 2] | [Definition] |

## Target Audience

### Primary Personas 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
Define 2-4 primary personas. Each persona should represent a distinct user type 
with different needs and motivations. Downstream PRDs will reference these by name.
-->

| Persona | Description | Core Need | Current Alternative |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Persona Name 1] | [Who they are, role, context] | [What they need most] | [How they solve it today] |
| [Persona Name 2] | [Who they are, role, context] | [What they need most] | [How they solve it today] |

### Persona Prioritization 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- When personas have conflicting needs, who wins? This prevents scope debates downstream. -->

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["🥇 [Persona 1]<br/>Primary"] --> B["🥈 [Persona 2]<br/>Secondary"]
    B --> C["🥉 [Persona 3]<br/>Tertiary"]
```

> **Rationale:** [Why this ordering? What business or user outcome does it optimize for?]

### Anti-Personas 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- Who is this product explicitly NOT for? Prevents feature creep driven by edge-case users. -->

| Anti-Persona | Why Excluded |
|--------------|--------------|
| [Anti-persona 1] | [Reason — e.g., "Enterprise IT admins — serving them would require compliance features that slow the core experience"] |

---

## Market Context

### Problem Landscape 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
What is broken in the world this product addresses? 
This is broader than a single PRD's problem statement — it's the ecosystem-level pain.
-->

[2-3 paragraphs: What systemic problems exist? What are the consequences of inaction — for users, for the business, for the market?]

### Competitive Landscape 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
LLM may draft based on public information, but human must validate 
accuracy, positioning, and strategic interpretation.
-->

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| [Competitor 1] | [What they do well] | [Where they fall short] | [Why we win against them] |
| [Competitor 2] | [What they do well] | [Where they fall short] | [Why we win against them] |

- [Trend 2]
- [Trend 3]

---

## Strategic Goals 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
3-5 high-level goals the product must achieve to fulfill the vision.
Each goal should be measurable and time-bounded.
PRDs should trace back to at least one strategic goal.
-->

| ID | Goal | Time Horizon | How We Measure It |
|----|------|-------------|-------------------|
| G-1 | [Goal statement] | [e.g., 6 months] | [Leading or lagging indicator] |
| G-2 | [Goal statement] | [e.g., 12 months] | [Leading or lagging indicator] |

    G-3 --> G-4
```

## Product Principles 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
Principles guide decision-making when requirements conflict.
Each principle should be opinionated enough to actually exclude some choices.
A good test: does the opposite of your principle sound like a reasonable strategy someone else might choose?
-->

| # | Principle | Implication | What We'd Sacrifice |
|---|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| P-1 | [e.g., "Speed over completeness"] | [e.g., "Ship a working MVP before polishing edge cases"] | [e.g., "We may launch with known low-severity limitations"] |
| P-2 | [Principle] | [Implication] | [What We'd Sacrifice] |
| P-3 | [Principle] | [Implication] | [What We'd Sacrifice] |

---

## High-Level Roadmap 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
Define major phases or milestones. Each phase should deliver distinct user value.

## Technical Strategy 🟡 `@human-review`

<!-- 
High-level technical direction. Not implementation details — those belong in ARs.
This section ensures technical choices align with the product vision's time horizon and scale ambitions.
-->

### Architecture Principles

- **[Principle 1]:** [e.g., "API-first — all capabilities must be accessible programmatically before building UI"]

|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| [e.g., "Primary language"] | [e.g., "Rust"] | [Why] | [When to reconsider — e.g., "If latency targets relax to >500ms"] |
| [e.g., "Data storage"] | [e.g., "PostgreSQL + Redis"] | [Why] | [When to reconsider] |

### Scale Targets 🟡 `@human-review`

| Milestone | Users | Throughput | Data Volume | Timeline |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Launch | [e.g., 100] | [e.g., 10 req/s] | [e.g., 1 GB] | [Date] |
| Phase 2 | [e.g., 10,000] | [e.g., 500 req/s] | [e.g., 100 GB] | [Date] |
| Phase 3 | [e.g., 1M] | [e.g., 10K req/s] | [e.g., 10 TB] | [Date] |

---

## Constraints & Boundaries 🟡 `@human-review`

### Business Constraints

- **Budget:** [e.g., "Must operate within $X/month infrastructure budget through Phase 2"]
- **Timeline:** [e.g., "Phase 1 must ship before Q3 for partnership commitment"]
- **Team:** [e.g., "2 engineers, 1 designer through Phase 1"]

### Regulatory & Compliance

- [e.g., "Must comply with GDPR for EU users from launch"]
- [e.g., "SOC 2 Type II required before enterprise sales (Phase 2 exit criteria)"]

### Platform & Integration Constraints

- [e.g., "Must integrate with existing OAuth provider"]
- [e.g., "Must support deployment to AWS and GCP"]

---

## Success Metrics 🔴 `@human-required`

<!-- 
Vision-level metrics. These are the ultimate scoreboard.
PRD-level metrics should roll up into these.
-->

### North Star Metric

| Metric | Definition | Current Baseline | 6-Month Target | 18-Month Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| [e.g., "Weekly active workflows"] | [Precise definition] | [Current or N/A] | [Target] | [Target] |

### Supporting Metrics
