## Core Principles

### I. Crate-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature MUST begin as a standalone crate within the Cargo workspace before integration. Crates must be:

- **Self-contained**: Minimal dependencies on sibling crates (use trait abstractions and dependency injection via generics or trait objects)
- **Independently testable**: Full test coverage without requiring the full workspace
- **Clearly purposed**: Single responsibility with explicit public API boundaries
- **API-documented**: All public items documented with `rustdoc` comments

**Prohibited**: Monolithic god-crates, kitchen-sink utility crates, or crates that exist solely to group code. Every crate must provide concrete, reusable functionality.

**Crate Boundaries** (adapt to your project):

```
workspace/
├── Cargo.toml              # Workspace root
├── crates/
│   ├── core/               # Shared types, traits, error types
│   ├── config/             # Configuration loading and validation
│   ├── api/                # HTTP API layer (axum/actix-web)
│   ├── scanner/            # Core scanning/analysis engine
│   ├── rules/              # Rule definitions and evaluation
│   ├── reporting/          # Output formatting and report generation
│   ├── storage/            # Persistence layer (database, filesystem)
│   ├── queue/              # Job queue management
│   ├── cache/              # Caching layer
│   └── cli/                # CLI binary entry point
```

**Binary vs Library Crates**: Binary crates (`cli`, `api`) are thin wrappers that compose library crates. Business logic lives in library crates. Binary crates handle startup, configuration wiring, and signal handling only.

**Public API Design**:
- Use `pub(crate)` by default; only `pub` items that are part of the crate's contract
- Re-export key types from `lib.rs` for ergonomic imports
- Use feature flags for optional functionality, not separate crates for small variations

**Rationale**: Crate-first architecture enables independent compilation, testing, and potential future extraction to separate repositories if needed. Rust's compilation model rewards well-defined crate boundaries with faster incremental builds.

### II. Rust-First with Strategic FFI Integration

This project uses Rust as the sole primary language:

- **Rust** MUST be used for all application logic, CLI, API, and worker processes
- **FFI boundaries** (if needed) MUST be:
  - Wrapped in safe Rust abstractions
  - Documented with safety invariants
  - Tested with both unit tests and integration tests
  - Isolated in dedicated `-sys` or `-ffi` crates
- **Build scripts** (`build.rs`) MUST be minimal and well-documented
- **Unsafe code** MUST be:
  - Justified with a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining why the invariant holds
  - Isolated behind safe public APIs
  - Minimized — prefer safe alternatives even at modest performance cost
  - Audited via `cargo geiger` in CI

**Decision Framework**:
1. **Need C library integration?** → Create a `-sys` crate with safe wrapper
2. **Performance-critical hot path?** → Profile first, use unsafe only with measured justification
3. **When in doubt**: Safe Rust. The compiler is your ally.

**Rationale**: Rust's ownership model and type system eliminate entire classes of bugs at compile time. FFI boundaries are the primary source of soundness risk and must be treated with extreme care.

### III. Contract-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

API contracts, trait definitions, and type schemas MUST be defined before implementation:

- **Trait Definitions**: Define behavior contracts as traits before implementing them
- **Type Definitions**: Define request/response types, error types, and domain models before business logic
- **API Schemas**: Define HTTP endpoints using OpenAPI via `utoipa` decorators before handler implementation
- **Database Schemas**: Define migrations (via `sqlx` or `diesel`) before data access code
- **CLI Interface**: Define `clap` argument structures before command handlers
- **Error Types**: Define error enums with `thiserror` before writing fallible functions

**Contract Review Process**:
1. Define traits, types, and error enums in the crate's `lib.rs` or `types.rs`
2. Add `rustdoc` documentation with examples for all public items
3. Review and approve contract before implementation
4. Implement using the defined types
5. Integration tests verify contract compliance

**Rationale**: Rust's type system is powerful enough to encode contracts at the type level. Defining types first leverages the compiler as a contract enforcement mechanism.

### IV. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is mandatory for all production code:

- Tests MUST be written before implementation
- Tests MUST fail before implementation begins (`cargo test` shows red)
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be followed strictly
- Pull requests without tests for new functionality MUST be rejected
- Tests MUST be automated and run in CI/CD pipeline
- Minimum coverage targets: 80% line coverage (measured via `cargo-tarpaulin` or `cargo-llvm-cov`)

**TDD Cycle**:
1. **Write Test**: Create test demonstrating desired behavior
2. **User Review**: Test reviewed and approved BEFORE implementation
3. **Verify Failure**: Test must FAIL with clear error message
4. **Implement**: Write minimal code to pass test
5. **Verify Pass**: Test must PASS
6. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining passing tests

**Testing Stack**:
- **Unit Tests**: In-module `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/` directory at crate root
- **Doc Tests**: `rustdoc` examples that compile and run
- **Property Tests**: `proptest` or `quickcheck` for invariant validation
- **Snapshot Tests**: `insta` for output-sensitive testing (reports, CLI output)
- **Benchmark Tests**: `criterion` for performance regression detection

**Test Organization**:
```rust
// Unit tests — same file as implementation
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn scan_detects_known_vulnerability() {
        // Arrange, Act, Assert
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn async_operation_completes() {
        // Async test with tokio runtime
    }
}
```

```
// Integration tests — crate-level tests/ directory
// tests/integration_scan.rs
use my_crate::Scanner;

#[test]
fn end_to_end_scan_produces_report() {
    // Tests the public API only
}
```

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness and serves as living documentation. Rust's compiler catches many bugs, but logic errors still need tests. Security-critical code demands rigorous verification.

### V. Complete Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All tasks in `tasks.md` MUST be completed before feature branch merges:

**Binary Completion**: Tasks are either COMPLETE (✅ passing tests, documented, reviewed) or INCOMPLETE (❌). No "mostly done" or "good enough" states.

**Verification Checklist** (per task):
- [ ] All tests written and passing (`cargo test --workspace`)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] `rustdoc` documentation complete for public API
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Security review completed (no `unsafe` without justification, no secrets)
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested (up and down)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes with zero warnings

**No Partial Merges**: Feature branches merge only when ALL tasks complete. Use WIP commits on branch, but squash before merge.

**Rationale**: Partial implementations create technical debt and maintenance burden. Complete implementation ensures every merged feature is production-ready.

### VI. Performance-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Performance is a feature requirement, not an optimization:

**Baseline Requirements** (adapt to your project):
- CLI scan completion: < X seconds for typical project
- API endpoint p95 latency: < 100ms (non-compute endpoints)
- Memory usage: Peak RSS < X MB for standard workloads
- Startup time: < 500ms to first useful output
- Concurrent scans: Support N parallel operations without degradation

**Mandatory Benchmarks**:
- All hot paths benchmarked with `criterion`
- Performance regression tests in CI (compare against baseline)
- Memory profiling with `dhat` or `heaptrack` for allocation-heavy code
- Flamegraph generation for optimization targets (`cargo-flamegraph`)
- Benchmarks documented in `benches/` directory

**Optimization Strategy**: Profile first (`perf`, `flamegraph`), optimize hot paths, document tradeoffs. No premature optimization, but architect for performance from the start. Prefer zero-copy parsing, arena allocation for tree structures, and streaming processing over buffering.

**Rust-Specific Performance Practices**:
- Prefer `&str` over `String` in function parameters
- Use `Cow<'_, str>` when ownership is conditional
- Prefer iterators over collecting into intermediate `Vec`s
- Use `SmallVec` or `ArrayVec` for small, bounded collections
- Avoid unnecessary `clone()` — if you're cloning, justify it
- Use `#[inline]` sparingly and only with benchmark evidence

**Rationale**: Rust is chosen partly for performance. Establishing performance requirements upfront prevents costly rewrites and ensures we leverage the language's strengths.

### VII. Security-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Security is foundational, not bolted-on:

**Memory Safety**:
- `unsafe` code MUST have a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining invariants
- `unsafe` blocks MUST be minimized and isolated behind safe APIs
- `cargo geiger` MUST be run in CI to track unsafe usage
- All FFI boundaries MUST validate inputs before passing to foreign code

**Authentication & Authorization** (if API-facing):
- Authentication MUST be required for all endpoints
- Rate limiting enforced via middleware (e.g., `tower::limit`)
- Audit logging for all data access operations

**Input Validation**:
- All external input MUST be validated before processing
- Use strong types (newtypes) to prevent primitive obsession
- File paths MUST be canonicalized and checked against allowed directories
- Deserialization MUST use `serde` with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` where appropriate
- Size limits MUST be enforced on all user-provided input

**Secrets Management**:
- Secrets MUST never be committed to code (use environment variables or secret stores)
- API keys/credentials NEVER logged or exposed in errors
- Use `secrecy` crate for in-memory secret handling (zeroize on drop)
- `.env.example` used as template, actual `.env` in `.gitignore`

**Dependency Security**:
- `cargo audit` MUST be run in CI — block on any advisory
- `cargo deny` MUST enforce license and vulnerability policies
- Supply chain attacks mitigated via `cargo-vet` or `cargo-crev`
- Dependency tree reviewed for unnecessary transitive dependencies (`cargo tree`)

**Rationale**: Security-critical tooling must itself be secure. Rust's safety guarantees are a foundation, not a substitute for security-conscious design.

### VIII. Error Handling Standards

Errors must be actionable, contextual, and never expose internal state:

**Error Design Principles**:
- Use `thiserror` for library error types (structured, composable)
- Use `anyhow` (or `eyre`) ONLY in binary crates and tests, never in library crates
- Error types MUST be enums with meaningful variants, not stringly-typed
- Every error variant MUST carry enough context to diagnose the problem
- Use `.context()` / `.with_context()` to add call-site information

**Standard Error Pattern**:
```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum ScanError {
    #[error("Rule file not found: {path}")]
    RuleNotFound { path: PathBuf },

    #[error("Failed to parse rule '{rule_id}': {source}")]
    RuleParse {
        rule_id: String,
        #[source]
        source: ParseError,
    },

    #[error("Scan timed out after {elapsed:?} (limit: {limit:?})")]
    Timeout {
        elapsed: Duration,
        limit: Duration,
    },
}
```

**User-Facing vs Internal Errors**:
- CLI errors: Human-readable with actionable suggestions (use `miette` for rich diagnostics)
- API errors: Structured JSON following RFC 7807 Problem Details
- Internal logs: Full context with `tracing` spans
- Never expose: File system paths, internal module structure, or stack traces to end users

**The `?` Operator**:
- Prefer `?` with proper `From` implementations over `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`
- `.unwrap()` is ONLY acceptable in tests and proven-safe scenarios with a comment
- `.expect("reason")` is acceptable where the invariant is documented and provably upheld

**Rationale**: Rust's `Result` type makes error handling explicit. Well-designed error types turn runtime debugging into compile-time guarantees about error handling completeness.

### IX. Observability & Debuggability

Every crate must be observable in production:

**Structured Logging**:
- Use the `tracing` crate (NOT `log`) for structured, span-based instrumentation
- All public functions SHOULD have `#[instrument]` attributes (skip sensitive fields)
- Log levels: `ERROR` (failures), `WARN` (degraded), `INFO` (operations), `DEBUG` (diagnostics), `TRACE` (verbose)
- Sensitive fields MUST be excluded from spans: `#[instrument(skip(password, api_key))]`

**Tracing Configuration**:
```rust
use tracing_subscriber::{fmt, EnvFilter, prelude::*};

tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(fmt::layer().json()) // Structured JSON in production
    .with(EnvFilter::from_default_env()) // RUST_LOG controls levels
    .init();
```

**Metrics & Instrumentation**:
- Prometheus metrics via `metrics` crate + `metrics-exporter-prometheus`
- Health check endpoints: `/health` (liveness), `/ready` (readiness with dependency checks)
- Custom business metrics: operation durations, queue depths, cache hit rates
- Use `tracing` spans for automatic timing of operations

**CLI Diagnostics**:
- Use `miette` for rich error reports with source code snippets and help text
- Support `--verbose` / `-v` flags mapped to `tracing` filter levels
- Support `--format json` for machine-readable output

**Rationale**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions extend to observability. The `tracing` ecosystem provides structured, span-based instrumentation with negligible overhead when disabled.

### X. Simplicity & Pragmatism

Start simple, add complexity only when justified:

- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle MUST be followed
- Premature optimization MUST be avoided — profile first, then optimize
- Third-party dependencies MUST be minimized and justified
- Design patterns MUST solve real problems, not demonstrate cleverness
- Complexity MUST be justified in documentation
- Monolithic binary preferred until proven bottlenecks require service extraction

**Dependency Principles**:
- Prefer well-maintained crates with active maintainers
- Check crate health: download count, recent commits, open issue response time
- Avoid crates with known soundness issues
- License compatibility: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause preferred
- Use `cargo deny` to enforce license and advisory policies

**Abstraction Guidelines**:
- Prefer concrete types over trait objects until polymorphism is needed
- Prefer generics over `dyn Trait` for performance-sensitive paths
- Don't create traits with a single implementation unless testing requires it or future extensibility is documented in a PRD
- Use modules for organization, crates for compilation boundaries

**Rationale**: Unnecessary complexity increases maintenance burden. Rust's type system already provides significant safety guarantees — don't add layers that duplicate what the compiler provides for free.

### XI. Current Dependency Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All dependencies MUST use the most recent stable versions to minimize security risks and technical debt:

**Definition of "Most Recent Stable"**:
- The newest non-pre-release version published on crates.io at the time of addition or update
- "Stable" excludes pre-release tags like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`

**Version Requirements**:
- New dependencies MUST be added at their latest stable version
  - Use `cargo add <crate>@latest` (or explicitly set the latest version in `Cargo.toml`)
  - Run `cargo update -p <crate>` to ensure `Cargo.lock` resolves to that latest version
- `Cargo.lock` is the source of truth for resolved versions and MUST be updated in the
  same PR whenever dependencies are added or upgraded
- Existing dependencies MUST be kept current (no more than 1 major version behind)
- Security patches MUST be applied within 1 week of release for advisories in `RustSec`
- Dependencies more than 2 major versions behind REQUIRE documented justification and remediation plan

**Pre-Addition Security Checks** (MANDATORY):
- ALL crates MUST be checked against the RustSec Advisory Database before adding:
  ```bash
  cargo audit
  cargo deny check advisories
  ```
- Review crate on `lib.rs` / `crates.io`: last update, downloads, maintainer activity
- Check for `unsafe` usage with `cargo geiger`
- Verify license compatibility with `cargo deny check licenses`
- Review dependency tree impact: `cargo tree -p <new-crate>` (avoid pulling in the world)

**Vulnerable Crates** (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN):
- Crates with active RustSec advisories MUST NOT be added
- Crates with known soundness issues MUST NOT be added
- Unmaintained crates (no commits in 12+ months, no response to issues) REQUIRE justification
- Vulnerable crates in production MUST be patched or replaced:
  - CRITICAL: 24 hours
  - HIGH: 1 week
  - MODERATE: 1 month

**Exception Process for Older Versions**:
Using an older crate version REQUIRES:
1. **Written justification** documenting why latest version cannot be used
2. **Risk assessment** of security implications and known advisories
3. **Approval** from tech lead or security team
4. **Remediation plan** with timeline for upgrading to current version
5. **Documentation** in `SECURITY.md` or `DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md`

**Acceptable Justifications** (examples):
- Breaking changes in latest version require extensive refactoring (with timeline)
- Dependency conflicts in workspace (with plan to resolve)
- Critical bug in latest version (with link to upstream issue)
- MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) constraints (with upgrade path)

**Unacceptable Justifications**:
- "It works fine" without security analysis
- "Don't have time to upgrade" without risk assessment
- "Too much effort" without documented plan
- Convenience or laziness

**Maintenance Procedures**:
- Run `cargo audit` in CI on every push (block on any advisory)
- Run `cargo outdated` weekly and create issues for crates >1 major behind
- Run `cargo deny check` in CI (advisories, licenses, sources)
- Quarterly dependency audit with `DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md` update
- Dependabot or Renovate configured for automated update PRs (with test gate)
- Track MSRV policy and document in `Cargo.toml` via `rust-version` field

**Rationale**: The Rust ecosystem moves quickly and security advisories are actively tracked via RustSec. Using current crates reduces vulnerability exposure, provides access to soundness fixes, and prevents accumulation of technical debt that becomes increasingly expensive to address.

### Rust Toolchain

**Required Tools**:
- `rustup` — Toolchain management
- `cargo` — Build system and package manager
- `rustfmt` — Code formatting (enforced in CI)
- `clippy` — Linting (enforced in CI, `-D warnings`)
- `cargo-audit` — Vulnerability scanning
- `cargo-deny` — License and advisory enforcement
- `cargo-tarpaulin` or `cargo-llvm-cov` — Code coverage
- `cargo-geiger` — Unsafe code auditing

**Recommended Tools**:
- `cargo-watch` — Auto-rebuild on file changes
- `cargo-expand` — Macro expansion debugging
- `cargo-flamegraph` — Performance profiling
- `cargo-outdated` — Dependency freshness checks
- `cargo-tree` — Dependency tree inspection

- `bacon` — Background code checker (alternative to cargo-watch)

**Rust Edition & MSRV**:
- Edition: 2021 (or 2024 when stable and beneficial)
- MSRV: Document in workspace `Cargo.toml` via `rust-version = "1.XX"`
- Update MSRV quarterly, tracking stable release schedule

### Infrastructure

- **Containers**: Docker with multi-stage builds (builder + runtime stages, `scratch` or `distroless` for minimal images)
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (local dev)
- **Environment**: `.env` files via `dotenvy` crate (template: `.env.example`)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or equivalent) with caching for `target/` directory

### Optional / Project-Specific

| **Template Engine** | `tera` or `askama` | Report generation |
| **Config** | `config` crate | Multi-source configuration |
| **Crypto** | `ring` or `rustls` | TLS, hashing, signatures |
| **Job Queue** | Custom with Tokio + Redis | Background processing |

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards

**Formatting**: `rustfmt` with project `.rustfmt.toml`:
```toml
edition = "2021"
max_width = 100
use_small_heuristics = "Max"
imports_granularity = "Module"
group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"
```

**Linting**: `clippy` with workspace-level configuration in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[workspace.lints.clippy]
all = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
nursery = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# Selectively allow where justified
module_name_repetitions = "allow"
must_use_candidate = "allow"
```

**Type Checking**: Rust compiler in strict mode:
```toml
[workspace.lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "warn"          # or "deny" for maximum safety
missing_docs = "warn"         # Enforce documentation
unused_results = "warn"       # Don't ignore Results
```

**Documentation**: `rustdoc` for all public APIs with examples:
```rust
/// Scans a target directory for security vulnerabilities.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `target` - Path to the directory to scan
/// * `config` - Scan configuration including rule sets
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`ScanError::NotFound`] if the target directory doesn't exist.
/// Returns [`ScanError::PermissionDenied`] if the directory is not readable.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::{Scanner, ScanConfig};
///
/// let scanner = Scanner::new(ScanConfig::default());
/// let results = scanner.scan("./target-project")?;
/// assert!(results.findings.is_empty());
/// ```
pub fn scan(&self, target: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Result<ScanReport, ScanError> {
    // ...
}
```

### Pre-commit Requirements

Enforced via Git hooks (e.g., `cargo-husky`, `pre-commit`, or custom `.githooks/`):

```bash
# Format check (fast, catches formatting issues)
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Lint check (catches common mistakes and anti-patterns)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Security audit (catches known vulnerabilities)
cargo audit

# License/advisory check
cargo deny check
```

Before every commit:
- Code MUST be formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- Clippy MUST pass with zero warnings
- `cargo audit` MUST pass with zero advisories
- Tests SHOULD pass (`cargo nextest run` or `cargo test`)
- Documentation SHOULD build without warnings (`cargo doc --no-deps`)

## Documentation Standards

### Rustdoc

All public items require comprehensive `rustdoc` comments:
- Module-level `//!` docs explaining purpose and usage patterns
- All public functions, structs, enums, and traits documented
- `# Examples` section with compilable, runnable code
- `# Errors` section listing when `Result::Err` is returned
- `# Panics` section if the function can panic (prefer not to panic)
- `# Safety` section for any `unsafe fn`

### API Documentation (if HTTP API)

Use `utoipa` for OpenAPI generation:
```rust
/// Search for vulnerabilities matching the given criteria.
#[utoipa::path(
    get,
    path = "/api/v1/scan/{scan_id}/findings",
    params(
        ("scan_id" = Uuid, Path, description = "Scan identifier"),
        ("severity" = Option<Severity>, Query, description = "Filter by severity")
    ),
    responses(
        (status = 200, description = "Findings retrieved", body = Vec<Finding>),
        (status = 404, description = "Scan not found"),
    ),
    security(("api_key" = []))
)]
async fn get_findings(
    Path(scan_id): Path<Uuid>,
    Query(params): Query<FindingsQuery>,
) -> Result<Json<Vec<Finding>>, AppError> {
    // ...
}
```

### Architecture Reviews and Decisions

- Architecture reviews use `docs/ar/` with the project's AR template
- Architecture decisions use `docs/adr/` with the ADR template

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitution changes MUST follow this process:
1. **Propose**: Document rationale and impact in GitHub issue
2. **Discuss**: Team discussion and approval (minimum 2 business days)
   - **Core Principles (I-XI)**: Require team consensus
   - **Standards & Workflow**: Can be updated with documented justification
   - **Technology Stack**: Can be updated as ecosystem evolves

### Versioning Policy

Constitution version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes (principle redefinition, new blocking requirements)
- **MINOR**: New principle added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, typo corrections

### Compliance Review

All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance:
- Reviewers MUST check against principles
- New crates MUST document purpose and boundaries in crate-level `//!` docs
- Breaking API changes MUST update OpenAPI specs (if applicable)
- Security changes MUST include threat consideration
- New dependencies MUST pass vulnerability scan and license check

### Constitution Authority

- This constitution supersedes all other development practices
- Conflicts between constitution and external guides MUST defer to constitution
- Constitution violations MUST be fixed or justified before merge
- Use CLAUDE.md for tactical development guidance (this constitution defines strategic principles)
